          <p>During initiation the project charter was developed and signed off on annually by the State Army Aviation Officer (SAAO) in the form of a series of 
            memorandums outlining his intentions for the year. These documents were then provided to me and the standardization instructor pilot for our company 
            to begin the planning phase with the various company level stakeholders.</p> 
            <p>The annual scope was generally easy to define and rarely changed for aircrew academics. There are specific subject areas that each aircrew member 
              must be trained on initially, and refreshed on annually with an exam documented annually to remain current on their assigned aircraft. These 
              requirements were continuously monitored and controlled throughout the training cycle so that if any requirements ever changed they would be 
              updated and implemented immediately across all levels.</p>
              <p>Scheduling training for an Army National Guard force can provide similar challenges to that of a dispersed workforce. Personnel with the 
                additional requirements that come with a flight slot generally commit themselves to additional periods of duty during the week to meet their 
                flight requirements. It is during this time that our instructor team were ever vigilant in continuously monitoring our members schedules so that 
                we could complete our required additional training and evaluations with them.</p>
                <p>Costs were predetermined the year prior to each training year by the SAAO and our upper echelon personnel (PMO). I would assist in developing 
                  the planning and cost estimates and they would later return an approved cost worksheet and training execution matrix. These costs could be 
                  adjusted later in the year if our justification request was approved on a case by case basis.</p>
                  Planning and identifying risk is an ongoing and important step that is never overlooked in aviation. It must be monitored and controlled 
                  throughout every step of the process. Therefore, it was an integral piece in my program as well. I integrated risk planning and management by 
                  ensuring that there was adequate time for safety briefings to be conducted prior to flights and that non-rated air crew members were actively 
                  participating in them. I also utilized real world experiences when providing training scenarios to drive the importance of risk management home 
                  to newer aircrew members.
                  <p>My goal was to develop and implement a program that would ensure that all non-rated aircrew members received training that consistently 
                    provided them with training that not only met the standards set forth by the applicable regulations but also solidified the information in a 
                    way that they would be able to act from muscle memory under pressure if the need ever arose.</p>
                    <p>To do this I relied on a variation of methods and empowered the rest of my instructor team to engage our crew members in the same way. 
                      Virtual training was broken down into subsections by month, so we would develop flight scenarios that focused on malfunctions that could 
                      arise in relation to the same subsections that our crew members saw during their OAATS training that month. We would then take it a step 
                      further and often ask them to correlate those scenarios into other required tasks such as emergency egress and marshaling passengers to a 
                      designated area. The are scenarios that they may encounter in a real life situation but could easily forget if not given the opportunity to 
                      break down what is happening in a controlled environment over and over again first.</p>
                      <p>Our artifacts were originally stored in Sharepoint which more recently underwent a migration to MS Teams. During our personnel's monthly 
                        or annual duty period we would gather lessons learned both formally and informally and file them for collection and consolidation at the 
                        end of the year for our SAAO and PMO's review and sign off.</p>

          <img class="img" src="./images/about.JPG" style="border-radius:10%; height: 50%; width: 50%; align-self: center;">
          <p>I'm a former UH-60 crew chief, flight instructor, training/readiness NCO who also had my realtor license for a little bit and is learning to 
            code on the side.</p> 
            
            <p>I managed all the spinning plates in my life like a project manager before I even knew about the PMBOK. Then one day in 2020 someone came
            to me and mentioned it to me and I thought "wow, somebody actually took the time to piece together all of this craziness."</p>

            <p>Then I studied the agile methodologies and things started to make sense, the reasons I had been successful in certain areas made perfect sense, 
              and my shortcomings were also crystal clear. </p>
              
              <p>Now, as I'm moving on from my full-time position with the military I am excited to take on a new challenge with a 
              company focused on the future.
          </p>
