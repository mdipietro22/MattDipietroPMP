          <p>The U.S. Army's aerial gunnery program has been governed by a few changes in regulations over the year's. Generally, National Guard door gunnery 
            program's struggle to fully adapt and meet the requirements due to the sometimes restrictive nature of the regulations along with limited range 
            availability in most areas.</p>
          <p>When I received authority over the program our company was in the process of updating to a new regulation and securing a range that would be able 
            to facilitate the new requirements for, what we hoped would be, years to come. My first job was to gather all requirements from the regulation, match 
            them with what the chosen range facility had to offer, identify any shortcomings, then create a solution that would still allow our company personnel 
            to qualify all non-rated personnel each year.</p> 
            <p>Fortunately, the chosen range had almost all of the requirements that we would need and there were a few other ranges that we could reserve in later 
              years as an alternate plan if they stopped becoming a viable solution.</p>
              <p>However, due to the new regulation, most of our company artifacts were now obsolete. That meant that we would need to create or find the following:</p>
                <p class="center"><strong>PPT Presentation on the M240H and Aerial Gunnery Procedures</strong></p>
                <li>Pulled from U.S. Army Gunnery Branch guidance for presentation to all non-rated and rated aircrew members by myself or one of the other non-rated 
                  flight instructors prior to the written test and hands-on instruction</li><br>
                  <p class="center"><strong>50 Question Written Skills Test</strong></p>
                  <li>Created by myself and the non-rated flight instructor team and updated annually utilizing the door gunnery PPT and all applicable references</li><br>
                    <p class="center"><strong>Day of Event Timelines</strong></p>
                    <li>Generally created in collaboration with the event officer in charge. This document contained estimated fuel usage and flight times for mission 
                      planning purposes. It also laid the frame work for the firing order that would later be used by personnel executing the event.</li><br>
                      <p class="center"><strong>Firing Order</strong></p>
                      <li>Created by me and contains details of who needs to be on which aircraft when. Due to limited flight instructor availability it was 
                        crucial to the successful and timely qualification of everyone that each person be where they need to be when they need to be there. The firing 
                        order would get better each year through lessons learned, adding in names to the ammunition detail, including ammunition cans and rounds, and 
                        compressing everything to be printed on one page are examples.</li><br>
                        <p class="center">Safety is always the number one concern when running an event with stakes as high as this. So, anything resulting in a safe completion is a 
                          win. However, a 100% qualification rate every year is also a very great accomplishment that my former company continues to be very proud of.</p>

          <img class="img" src="./images/about.JPG" style="border-radius:10%; height: 50%; width: 50%; align-self: center;">
          <p>I'm a former UH-60 crew chief, flight instructor, and training/readiness NCO who also had my realtor license for a bit and is learning to 
            code on the side.</p> 
            
            <p>I managed all these spinning plates in my life like a project manager before I even knew about the PMBOK. Then one day in 2020 someone mentioned project management
              as a career path and I thought "huh, that sounds alot like what I'm already doing." So, I looked into it, started studying and sat for the PMP 
              in early 2022.
            </p>
    
              <p>Now, as I'm moving on from my full-time position with the military I am excited to take on a new challenge with a 
              company focused on building a better future and focusing on the many current issues facing the world.
